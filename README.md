## Description

Development of a sistemy basead in Web Services, implemented in the J2EE plarform, to aggregate services of good transporters, similar to Uber's service with passengers.

The main components of the system are clients, a broker, transporters and a name server (UDDI). The transporters publish themselves in the name server. The broker uses this server to find them and negotiate the services requested by the clients. All the operations are described in a WSDL contract.
Here is a simple figure of the system's architecture:

In addition, the system is composed by other components that guarantee reliability and security. The broker has a primary backup to prevent its failure. The authenticity, fresheness and integrity of the communication between the broker and the transporters are guaranteed using digital signatures. The keys used in this signatures are generated by a CA that was also implemented as part of the project.


The broker is the most complex component and is divided in 4 modules:
* *broker-ws* that communicates with the client
* *transporter-ws-cli* that communicates with the transporters
* *ca-ws-cli* that communicates with the CA
* *broker-ws-cli* that communicates with the backup broker


The client is just a *broker-ws-cli* module and the transporter a *transporter-ws*.


Basic rules of operation:

1) The client requests a transport from an *origin* to a *destination* for a *maximum price*
2) The broker asks a *budget* to all the transporters
3) The broker assigns the task to the transporter which offered the lowest value


All the states of a service are described bellow:

There are some rules concerning max and min price as well as areas of operation of transporters according to odd or even id (for further details refer to [enunciado (portuguese only)](https://github.com/abaguas/UpaTransporter/blob/master/enunciado.pdf))

## Dependencies

Refer to [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/abaguas/UpaTransporter/blob/master/INSTALL.md)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Installing instructions


### Environment

[0] Boot the OS

Linux or Mac OS X


[1] Initiate the support servers

JUDDI:
```
./juddi-3.3.2_tomcat-7.0.64_9090/bin/startup.sh
```


[2] Create temporary folder

```
mkdir temp
cd temp/
```


[3] Obtain source code of the project

```
git clone https://github.com/abaguas/UpaTransporter.git (via https) 
git clone git@github.com:abaguas/UpaTransporter.git (via ssh)
```



[4] Install auxiliary libraries and modules

```
cd uddi-naming
mvn clean install
```


### Certificate Authority

[1] Build and execute the **server**

```
cd ca-ws
mvn clean install
mvn exec:java
```

[2] Build the **client**

```
cd ca-ws-cli
mvn clean install
```


### Transporter

[1] Build and execute the **server**

```
cd transporter-ws
mvn clean install
mvn exec:java
```

and in other tab (the tests that will be run on the broker client require 2 transporters executing)

```
cd transporter-ws
mvn exec:java -Dws.i=2
```

[2] Build the **client**

```
cd transporter-ws-cli
mvn clean install
```


### Broker

[1] Build and execute the **server**

```
cd broker-ws
mvn clean install
mvn exec:java
```


[2] Build the client **client**

```
cd broker-ws-cli
mvn clean install
```

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Running instructions

You can keep the 2 Transporters and the CA running.
Then launch the Broker:

```
cd broker-ws
mvn exec:java
```

And launch the backup Broker:

```
cd broker-ws
mvn exec:java -Dws.br=2
```

Follow the instructions on both terminals (i.e. on the primal Broker press "enter" and, after, on the backup Broker press "enter")


Now launch the Client:
```
cd broker-ws-cli
mvn exec:java
```


You can (and should) kill the Broker's process to verify that the primary Backup is working correctly.

Disclaimer: It was not the aim of this project to provide a interface to the client, it only runs a small demonstration. The tests verify the correctness of all the operation implemented in the system.


PS: The prints are meant to better understand the operations that the system is performing.
